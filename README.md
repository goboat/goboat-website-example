## GoBoat Website Example

The content of this repository is the contents of the folder `frontends/website` from our monorepo, with some changes to enable to run as a standalone, fetching it's content from our live APIs.

To get this up and running, three commands are needed:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run generate
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/da](http://localhost:3000/da) with your browser to see the result.

Note that the content is from the live site, so if you for instance sign up to the newsletter or fill out some form intended for customers, our team will see your submissions as well, so use with caution.
